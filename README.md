### **Strategy**

To be in line with UX principles, first i thought  of a strategy to identify who the target users would be and what features they are looking for

* Next button to sail through the various questions with ease 
* Reload button to relaunch the quiz once complete, to try again 
* Simple and easy to understand text that states the score out of total questions 
* Interactive result text, which pops whether correct or incorrect  

### **Structure**

This is a single page website that includes quiz area, inside which there's quiz images, input text box, submit button, next button and reload button, sections to show score and result. 

### **Skeletal**

While creating a draft for this website and during the building process, i used different background colors, however, i felt the images that i have used will contrast well with a white background for quiz area and rest of body has yellow to contrast with the neon blue buttons.

The overall background of this website is Yellow with white background for quiz area, keeping in mind the colors of the images and the button colors i have used
