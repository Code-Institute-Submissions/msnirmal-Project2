## **UX**
---
### **Strategy**

To be in line with UX principles, first i thought  of a strategy to identify who the target users would be and what features they are looking for 

Animal quiz target users are:
* Aged 15 & over (Can be under 15's with parental permission to use electronics)
* Animal lovers 
* People who have passion for nature and its creation  

User requirements:
* Website that's simple and meets the purpose
* Ease of navigation  
* Basic content for the understanding of kids under 15
* To be able to view on all devices 

### **Scope**

* Title header which is self explanatory and navigation links to access various sections of the page 
* Stunning Images of animals in their natural habitat
* Submit button that doesn't allow you click more than once to basically test your knowledge
* Next button to sail through the various questions with ease 
* Reload button to relaunch the quiz once complete, to try again 
* Simple and easy to understand text that states the score out of total questions 
* Interactive result text, which pops whether correct or incorrect  

### **Structure**

This is a single page website that includes quiz area, inside which there's quiz images, input text box, submit button, next button and reload button, sections to show score and result. 

### **Skeletal**

While creating a draft for this website and during the building process, i used different background colors, however, i felt the images that i have used will contrast well with a white background for quiz area and rest of body has yellow to contrast with the neon blue buttons. 

### **Surface**

The overall background of this website is Yellow with white background for quiz area, keeping in mind the colors of the images and the button colors i have used
